# Problem

238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Example

```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: [24, 12, 8, 6]
Explanation: For each element in the array, the corresponding value in the output is the product of all elements in the original array except the element itself.
```

# Approach

On day 5, I encountered a challenge in understanding the requirements of the problem, but after careful analysis, I successfully devised a solution. The problem involves finding the product of all elements in the array except the current element, and the solution must run in O(n) time without using the division operation.

The approach I used involves calculating two auxiliary arrays, `prefix` and `postfix`, to represent the product of all elements to the left and right of the current element, respectively. After calculating these arrays, the result array (`res`) is obtained by multiplying the corresponding elements from `prefix` and `postfix`.

# Code

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        prefix = [1] * n  # Initialize prefix array with all 1s
        postfix = [1] * n  # Initialize postfix array with all 1s
        res = []

        # Calculate prefix products
        product = 1
        for i in range(n):
            prefix[i] = product
            product *= nums[i]

        # Calculate postfix products and multiply them with the result
        product = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            postfix[i] = product
            product *= nums[i]

        # Calculate the result array
        for i in range(n):
            res.append(prefix[i] * postfix[i])

        return res
```

# How it works

Let's go through an example to illustrate how the provided solution calculates the product of all elements in the array except the current element:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

The goal is to find an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. The code achieves this by calculating two auxiliary arrays, `prefix` and `postfix`, which represent the product of all elements to the left and right of the current element, respectively. Let's step through the process:

1. **Initialization:**
   ```python
   prefix = [1, 1, 1, 1]
   postfix = [1, 1, 1, 1]
   res = []
   ```

   This initializes the `prefix` and `postfix` arrays with all 1s and an empty list `res`.

2. **Calculate Prefix Products:**
   The first `for` loop iterates through each element in the input array `nums`. For each element, it updates the `prefix` array by multiplying the current product with the previous product and storing it in the corresponding position.

   After processing the example `nums`, the `prefix` array would look like this:
   ```python
   [1, 1, 2, 6]
   ```

3. **Calculate Postfix Products:**
   The second `for` loop runs in reverse, iterating through each element in the input array `nums`. For each element, it updates the `postfix` array by multiplying the current product with the previous product and storing it in the corresponding position.

   After processing the example `nums`, the `postfix` array would look like this:
   ```python
   [24, 12, 4, 1]
   ```

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   The final `for` loop iterates through each element in the input array `nums` and calculates the product of the corresponding elements from `prefix` and `postfix`. The result is appended to the `res` array.

   After processing the example `nums`, the `res` array would look like this:
   ```python
   [24, 12, 8, 6]
   ```

5. **Returning the Result:**
   The function returns the `res` array, which contains the product of all elements in the array except the current element.

In summary, this code efficiently calculates the product of all elements in the array except the current element by maintaining two auxiliary arrays (`prefix` and `postfix`). The result is obtained by multiplying the corresponding elements from these arrays. The algorithm runs in O(n) time and avoids using the division operation, as required by the problem.
